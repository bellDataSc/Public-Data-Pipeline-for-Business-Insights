# Public Data Pipeline for Business Insights

This project simulates a complete data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and analyzes **public data sources** (e.g., IBGE, Brazilian Federal Revenue) to generate insights that support **data-driven decision making**.

## 🔍 Objective

To showcase how public data can be organized and processed into reusable pipelines to extract value in fields such as public administration, education, media, and regional economic development.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, requests)
- Streamlit or Power BI (for dashboards)
- Google BigQuery / SQLite / CSV
- Public APIs (IBGE, company registries, etc.)
- OBS: with **Kotlin** — especially useful if you're working with data in lists, JSON, or APIs. Exemplo: Salvando CSV em Kotlin.

## 💡 Use Cases

- Ranking cities by educational potential
- Clustering regional economic profiles
- Exploratory analysis of population and consumption behavior
